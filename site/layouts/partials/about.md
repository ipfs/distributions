#### Welcome to IPFS Distributions

This is the downloads website for all the official software distributions of the
[IPFS Project](https://ipfs.tech). You can find all the apps, binaries, and
packages here. Every distribution has a section on this page with ...

* the distribution name and a short description
* the current version number and release date
* the software license (usually MIT)
* a download button that detects your platform
* a grid with download links for all supported platforms (os and architectures)
* `Changelog`, a link to a summary of all version changes
* `All Versions`, a link to view and download previous versions

The `All Versions` link on each distribution shows directory listings for all
the available versions, and a `versions` file
([example](http://dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/versions)). This file can be used by
tools, such as [ipfs-update](#ipfs-update), to find all the available versions
and download the latest.

The directory listing of each version
([example](http://dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/v0.14.0)) has all the platform archives
(`.zip` or `.tar.gz`), a `README.md` and a `dist.json` which describe the
release for humans and machines. It is meant to be easily consumed and used by
tools.
